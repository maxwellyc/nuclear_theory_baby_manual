## nuclear_theory_baby_manual

### Description
Detailed manual and related codes for all the theoretical calculations and data analysis I have or will make during my research life.

### Goals
Allow anyone with access to internet and a computer, or high-performance-computers (hpc) if you want to do real-life large scale calculations, to be able to go through every step of my calculations without difficulties, and reproduce my results exactly (numerical instability aside).

### Motivations
#### Make research truly reproducible: 
    A lot of my research hours are spent on doing something other people already figured out, but since no one cared (in my field) to write their processes down, I had to invent the wheel again, which is a huge waste of research funding, and my life. Sometimes theorist have so many different codes and versions and trials, such that after a few other projects and years, they forgot which file they used for their published calculations, which to me is bad practice. You shouldn't claim that your work is reproducible just because you are sure the relevant stuff is stored 'SOMEWHERE' on your hard drive, that's not how reproduction works, most of the time you can't find where it is (I know this happened to me and a few collaborators), at least not 100% certain if this was the exact file you used in that calculation, unless you haven't done enough calculations and data analysis.
    
#### Accessible by anyone who cares
    In the event that I get captured by aliens, or that I left academia for some years and someone else tries to do something related using these codes I have used, I'd like to have some sort of instructions ready for that person, so he (or she) can just figure it out on his own, with minimum overlap over the things I already went through.
    And just in case someone somewhere on the internet decided he wants a shot at nuclear physics, these files would allow him to go for it, maybe he thinks this is interesting and decide to become a physicist too, good for him.
    
### What'll be included
    I'll be providing all the codes, input files, Makefiles, hpc (library) specs, enough for you to run directly without debugging. I'll also provide step by step instructions, this should be, eventually, as easy as building legos or IKEA furnitures, every piece will fit. I'll also be adding some iPython notebooks for my data analysis and plotting processes. Since I'll be graduating and applying for a job, I'll be doing this whenever I have the time, this project will be completed, even if I can't finish this before my graduation.
